        The study bay, as the name suggests, was<br>originally a projecting window
        built to provide a place for reading. Over the years it came to be
        regarded as no more than a source of light for the alcove; but most
        often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as to soften the
        sidelong rays from without, to filter them through paper panels.
      </p>

      <p id="p8two">
        There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it reaches
        these panels.

        The little sunlight from the garden that manages to make its way beneath
        the eaves and through the corridors has by then lost its power to
        illuminate, seems drained of the complexion of life. It can do no more
        than accentuate the whiteness of the paper.
      </p>

      <p id="p8four">
        I sometimes linger before these panels and study the surface of the
        paper, bright, but giving no impression of brilliance.
