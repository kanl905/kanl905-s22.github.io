        Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a
        hanging scroll and a flower arrangement. But the scroll and the flowers
        serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows.
      </p>

      <p id="p4two">
        We value a scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the
        alcove, and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the
        calligraphy or painting.
      </p>

      <p id="p4three">
        Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it
        fails to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular
        distinction may blend beautifully with the room and set off to
        unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings.
      </p>

      <p id="p4four">
        Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting will possess a
        certain look of antiquity, and this look of antiquity will strike just
        the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.
