        In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to
        throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put
        together a house.
      </p>

      <p id="p2two">
        There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to
        keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from
        without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as
        possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible.
      </p>

      <p id="p2three">
        If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western
        house is no more than a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to
        allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves.
      </p>

      <p id="p2four">
        There are no doubt all sorts of reasonsâ€”climate, building materials-for
        the deep Japanese eaves.
      </p>

      <p id="p2five">
        The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for instance,
        made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain.
      </p>

      <p id="p2six">
        A light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than
        a dark room.
      </p>

      <p id="p2seven">
        The quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the
        realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms,
        presently came to discover beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide
        shadows towards beauty's ends.
