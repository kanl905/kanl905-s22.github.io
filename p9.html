        In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance
        from the garden; so dilute is the light there that no matter what the
        season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale,
        white glow scarcely varies.
      </p>

      <p id="p9two">
        And the shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely immobile,
        as if dust collected in the corners had become a part of the paper
        itself.
      </p>

      <p id="p9three">
        I blink in uncertainty at this dreamlike luminescence, feeling as though
        some misty film were blunting my vision.
      </p>

      <p id="p9four">
        The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy
        darkness of the alcove, is instead repelled by the darkness, creating a
        world of confusion where dark and light are indistinguishable.

        Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the light that suffuses
        such a room, a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light?
      </p>

      <p id="p9question2">
        Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the ageless, a fear
        that in that room you might lose all consciousness of the passage of
        time, that untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find you
        had grown old and gray?
