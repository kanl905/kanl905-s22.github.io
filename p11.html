      How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me.
    </p>

    <div class="para11">
      <p>
        But I see why in ancient times statues of the Buddha were gilt with gold
        and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes of the nobility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Modern man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold;
        but those who lived in the dark houses of the past were not merely
        captivated by its beauty, they also knew its practical value; for gold,
        in these dim rooms, must have served the function of a reflector.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere extravagance. Its
        reflective properties were put to use as a source of illumination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains its
        brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room.
      </p>

      <p>This is why gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.</p>
