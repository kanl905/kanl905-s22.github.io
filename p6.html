        A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, the
        paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the
        alcove where it is darkest.
      </p>

      <p id="p6two">
        Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel
        at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of
        shadow and light.
      </p>

      <p id="p6three">
        For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. An
        empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the
        light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness.
      </p>

      <p id="p6four">
        There is nothing more. And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that
        gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the
        shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are
        overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere
        there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the darkness
        immutable tranquility holds sway. The "mysterious Orient" of which
        Westerners speak probably refers to the uncanny silence of these dark
        places.
      </p>

      <p id="p6five">
        And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered
        into the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated.
      </p>

      <p id="p6six">
        Ultimately it is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be banished
        from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void.
